# APT29 Overview
While I am tracing back the history of the APT29 attack(YTTRIUM), I have a few questions, and I hope that these questions and my curiosity will help someone with their security incident response.

#### Agenda

## What is APT29 ?
APT29 (Advanced Persistent Threat 29), also known as Cozy Bear, is a cyber espionage group believed to be operating on behalf of the Russian government
that has been involved in high-profile cyber attacks against various targets, including government agencies and critical infrastructure. The group is known for using advanced hacking techniques, such as spear phishing and zero-day exploits, as well as social engineering tactics. 

## APT29 associated groups 
Yes, there are several groups associated with APT29, and each group uses different attack techniques - IRON RITUAL, IRON HEMLOCK, NobleBaron, Dark Halo, StellarParticle, NOBELIUM, UNC2452, YTTRIUM, The Dukes, Cozy Bear and CozyDuke.	
>**Note** : [MITRE ATT&CK | APT29 ](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)

## APT29 attack techniques
#### The most common attack techniques 
1. Spear-phishing emails
2. Watering hole attacks
3. Zero-day exploits
4. Remote access tools <Gh0st RAT>
5. Malware attacks <CozyDuke Hammertoss and SeaDuke>

Overall, APT29 is a highly sophisticated threat group that uses a combination of social engineering, advanced hacking techniques, and custom malware to gain access to target systems and steal sensitive information.

#### MITRE ATT&CK APT29 attack map
In the Cybereason blog, APT29 attack techniques are captured very well using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
