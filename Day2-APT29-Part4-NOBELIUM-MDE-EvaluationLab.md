# Day 2 - APT29, NOBELIUM, MDE Evaluation Lab
In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's Evaluation Lab(MDE), the APT29 attack simulation is covered. During this time, I will mainly focus on demonstrating MDE detection capabilities and how MDE captures the attack as EDR, XDR. Additionally, the available response capabilities of the product will be presented.
