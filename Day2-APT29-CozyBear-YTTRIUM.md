# Day 2 - APT29, Cozy Bear - YTTRIUM #WIP
While I am tracing back the history of the APT29 attack(YTTRIUM), I have a few questions, and I hope that these questions and my curiosity will help someone with their security incident response

#### What is APT29 ?
APT29 (Advanced Persistent Threat 29), also known as Cozy Bear, is a cyber espionage group believed to be operating on behalf of the Russian government
that has been involved in high-profile cyber attacks against various targets, including government agencies and critical infrastructure. The group is known for using advanced hacking techniques, such as spear phishing and zero-day exploits, as well as social engineering tactics. 

#### What are attack techniques of APT29 ?
1. Spear-phishing emails
2. Watering hole attacks
3. Zero-day exploits
4. Remote access tools <Gh0st RAT>
5. Malware attacks <CozyDuke Hammertoss and SeaDuke>

Overall, APT29 is a highly sophisticated threat group that uses a combination of social engineering, advanced hacking techniques, and custom malware to gain access to target systems and steal sensitive information.

#### What is YTTRIUM ? 
When you look at APT29, Microsoft Security blog, you might see "YTTRIUM". This is an excerpt from [a security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2018/12/03/analysis-of-cyberattack-on-u-s-think-tanks-non-profits-public-sector-by-unidentified-attackers/) - "Third-party security researchers have attributed the attack to a threat actor named APT29 or CozyBear, which largely overlaps with the activity group that Microsoft calls YTTRIUM"

> **Note** :
> Yttrium and Nobelium are two separate threat groups that have been linked to **APT29 (Cozy Bear) in the past**, but they are not the same group. 


## YTTRIUM Attack Chain 
The cyber attack by APT29, also known as YTTRIUM, is believed to have started with a spear-phishing email attack.
