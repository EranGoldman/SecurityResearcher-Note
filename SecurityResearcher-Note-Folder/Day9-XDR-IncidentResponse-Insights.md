# Day9 - XDR Incident Response insights
When organizations purchase E5 security, their first challenge is often product deployment. However, ***the next significant challenge arises in "security operations"***, particularly dealing with daily incident response. While Microsoft provides detailed insights and various features, SOC teams might feel overwhelmed when alerts and incidents are generated in their environment. 

When alerts/incidents were generated in your tenant, it is possible that some individuals may have the following concerns and challenges.

1. ***No idea where to start the investigation...***
2. ***Where exactly do I have to look ?***
3. ***What kind of options do I have ?***
4. ***What capabilities can I leverage in XDR ?***


In light of this, I aim to expand their understanding in ***XDR*** and ***Microsoft 365 Defender*** to help them overcome these challenges.
## What is XDR ?
Extended detection and response describes ***a unified security incident detection and response platform*** that automatically collects and ***correlates data from multiple proprietary security components***.
