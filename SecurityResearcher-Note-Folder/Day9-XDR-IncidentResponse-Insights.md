# Day9 - XDR Incident Response insights
When organizations purchase E5 security, their first challenge is often product deployment. However, ***the next significant challenge arises in "security operations"***, particularly dealing with daily incident response. While Microsoft provides detailed insights and various features, SOC teams might feel overwhelmed when alerts and incidents are generated in their environment. 

When alerts/incidents were generated in your tenant, it is possible that some individuals may have the following concerns and challenges.

1. ***No idea where to start the investigation...***
2. ***Where exactly do I have to look ?***
3. ***What kind of options do I have ?***
4. ***What capabilities can I leverage in XDR ?***


In light of this, I aim to expand their understanding in ***XDR*** and ***Microsoft 365 Defender*** to help them overcome these challenges.
Therefore, in this blog, I am going to explore the power of XDR, Microsoft 365 Defender.

## What is XDR ?
Extended detection and response describes ***a unified security incident detection and response platform*** that automatically collects and ***correlates data from multiple proprietary security components***.

## XDR, Microsoft 365 Defender
In Microsoft Security, we have an XDR solution called Microsoft 365 Defender, which provides a wide range of protection, including the following:

1. Microsoft Defender fot Office 365 (MDO) 
2. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDA)
3. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
4. Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI)
5. Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AADID)

## Gartner® Magic Quadrant™
Before we dive into the power of XDR and Microsoft 365 Defender in this blog, let's take a fascinating look at the market research results for Endpoint Protection/XDR over the past 2 years. 
As shown in the results over the past two years, Microsoft has consistently stayed its position as ***a Leader***. 

> According to [the Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2AJ91JO6&ct=220707&st=sb) in 2022, Microsoft's highest scores are for its market understanding and overall viability. This reflects the strong performance of its security business and an early move to define and ***evolve the emerging XDR category***. Microsoft achieved this through ***deep integration and automation between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and other Microsoft products***, particularly Azure Active Directory, enabling an emerging identity threat detection and response (ITDR) capability.
