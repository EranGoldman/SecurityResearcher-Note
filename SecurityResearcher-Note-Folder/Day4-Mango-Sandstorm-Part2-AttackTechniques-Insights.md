## August 25, 2022, Mango Sandstorm

Mango Sandstorm, previously known for using Log4j 2 exploits to attack VMware apps, has recently been targeting SysAid apps using the same technique. Once they gain initial access, the group establishes persistence, moves laterally within the network using custom and well-known hacking tools, and dumps credentials.

## April 7, 2023, Mango Sandstorm & Storm-1084
Mango Sandstorm, previously known for using Log4j 2 exploits and targeting on-premises environments, has now expanded its focus to include both on-premises and cloud environments. After gaining initial access through known vulnerabilities, the attack has been linked to Storm-1084 (formerly known as DEV-1084).
