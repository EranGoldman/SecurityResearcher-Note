# Day 10 - XDR Incident Response insights
When organizations purchase E5 security, their first challenge is often product deployment. However, ***the next significant challenge arises in "security operations"***, particularly dealing with daily incident response. While Microsoft provides detailed insights and various features, SOC teams might feel overwhelmed when alerts and incidents are generated in their environment. 

When alerts/incidents were generated in your tenant, some people may have the following concerns and challenges.

1. ***No idea where to start the investigation...***
2. ***Where exactly do I have to look ?***
3. ***What kind of options do I have ?***
4. ***What capabilities can I leverage in XDR ?***


In light of this, I aim to expand their understanding in ***XDR*** and ***Microsoft 365 Defender*** to help them overcome these challenges.
Therefore, in this blog, I am going to explore the power of XDR, Microsoft 365 Defender and now let's start with Part 1.
