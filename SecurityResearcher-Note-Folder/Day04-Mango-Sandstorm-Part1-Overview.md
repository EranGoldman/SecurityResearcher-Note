## What is Mango Sandstorm ?
Mango Sandstorm, formerly known as MERCURY, is ***an Iranian-based cyber activity group*** that specializes in sensitive data gathering through advanced cyber attacks, rather than financial gain. Their attack techniques include spear-phishing attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities, malware and social engineering.

To get the detailed insight, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence also covers Mango Sandstorm's description, TTP, and IOCs.

## Mango Sandstorm timeline
#### August 25, 2022
Mango Sandstorm, previously known for using Log4j 2 exploits to attack VMware apps, has recently been targeting SysAid apps using the same technique. Once they gain initial access, the group establishes persistence, moves laterally within the network using custom and well-known hacking tools, and dumps credentials.
