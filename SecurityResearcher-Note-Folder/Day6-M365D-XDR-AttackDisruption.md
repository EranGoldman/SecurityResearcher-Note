# Day 6 - XDR attack disruption  
Automatic attack disruption in Microsoft 365 Defender uses XDR signals from different sources (endpoints, email, identity, data) to ***automatically contain compromised assets and stop ongoing cyber attacks, minimizing their impact on organizations***.
#### What is the objective of attack disruption?
The main objective of this feature is to achieve ***containment*** during the incident response phase. In terms of automatic disruption, there are two actions that can be taken: ***"device contain"*** by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and ***"disable user"*** by Microsoft Defender for Identity.

## Advanced attacks vs XDR attack disruption
Microsoft 365 Defender XDR provides coverage for the following three advanced attacks to disrupt further progression.
1. Human-operated ransomware
2. Business email compromise (BEC)
3. Adversary-in-the-middle attacks (AiTM)
