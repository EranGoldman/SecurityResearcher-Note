# Day 6 - XDR automatic attack disruption  
Automatic attack disruption in Microsoft 365 Defender uses XDR signals from different sources (endpoints, email, identity, data) to ***automatically contain compromised assets and stop ongoing cyber attacks, minimizing their impact on organizations***.
#### What is the objective of attack disruption?
The main objective of this feature is to achieve ***containment*** during the incident response phase. In terms of automatic disruption, there are two actions that can be taken: ***"device contain"*** by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and ***"disable user"*** by Microsoft Defender for Identity.

## Advanced attacks vs XDR attack disruption
Microsoft 365 Defender XDR provides coverage for the following three advanced attacks to disrupt further progression.

1. Adversary-in-the-middle attacks (AiTM)
2. Business email compromise (BEC)
3. Human-operated ransomware attacks

##  AiTM insights
AiTM attack refers to ***"Adversary-in-The-Middle"*** phishing technique where attackers intercept communication between a user and a legitimate website, stealing passwords and session cookies to gain unauthorized access and perform fraudulent activities.

## BEC insights
Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a cyberattack where attackers deceive organizations through fraudulent emails. They impersonate trusted individuals to trick employees into taking unauthorized actions, such as transferring money or revealing sensitive information. BEC attacks can lead to financial losses and reputational damage for businesses.

## Human-operated ransomware insights
Human-operated ransomware attacks, also known as ***"hands-on-keyboard"*** attack, refer to a specific type of ransomware attack where skilled human attackers actively participate in various stages of the attack rather than relying solely on automated tools or malware.
