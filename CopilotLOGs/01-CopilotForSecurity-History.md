## Microsoft Security Blog
For the past year, I have been reading numerous security blogs about Microsoft Copilot for Security, which has made me even more surprised and excited to try it out in real life. These blogs have been very helpful for catching up on topics like ***"Generative AI", "Microsoft Copilot for Security", "AI". "Open AI", "Chat GPT"*** and so on.
