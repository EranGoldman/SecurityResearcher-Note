# Day 1 - Malware Analysis
Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software, also known as malware, to understand how it works and how it can be detected and prevented. While I haven't delved into deeper aspects of malware analysis such as reverse engineering, I have had the opportunity to explore basic malware analysis. I hope that sharing my logs will help someone who wants to take their first steps into malware analysis.

Basic malware analysis consists of both static and dynamic analysis, as I highlighted in the red line below:

# Analysis Tips
There are several points which analysts need to investigate during malware analysis. Here are some tips which are highly effective for the analysis.

| Static Analysis | Comment/Memo |
| :------------- | ------------- |
| File Type                         |Check the magic number. For example, "MZ" indicates a .exe file. |
| Packers                          |Check the packers - attacker uses compression such as UPX, MEW and so on to obfuscate PE file. |
| Timestamps                       |Check when the PE file was compiled. |
| Hash value                       |MD5, SHA1, SHA256 - you can leverage the values for various ways - registration as IoC and threat hunting. |
| Dll (Libraries)                  |Dll and Function help malware analysts to identify what capabilities the PE file has.|
| Function (Imports / Exports)     |Dll and Function help malware analysts to identify what capabilities the PE file has.|
| Strings                          |Find/Get hints for understanding the PE file such as IP, URL, Path, Dll, Function and etc. |
<br>

| Dynamic Analysis | Comment |
| :------------- | ------------- |
| Network indicator | In the static analysis phase, you could get some clues related to network activities from string values. For example, you can track the network activities such as **HTTP(80), DNS(53) or even filtering some URL keywords** by using Wireshark. |
| Host indicator    | In the static analysis phase, you could get some clues related to host activities from string values - **PE file, Process, Command, Path and so on.** These are highly invaluable keys in dynamic analysis. For instance, Tracking the timeline based activity for PE file. Monitoring the relation of PE file such as process tree. Confirming the activities one by one by suspending and resuming the process. Or even comparing registry key's activity before and after malware execution.|

# Analysis Tools 
During basic static/dynamic malware analysis, I usually use these tools and access websites as follows: <br>
### Static Analysis 
■ Pestudio (https://www.winitor.com/download) <br>
■ VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) <br>
■ floss (https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss) <br>
■ MalAPI.io (https://malapi.io/)

### Dynamic Analysis 
■ Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) <br>
■ TCPView (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview) <br>
■ Process Monitor (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) <br>
■ Process Explorer (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) <br>
■ Process Hacker (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) <br>
